## Quick Start

1. Ensure that **Java 25** is installed on your computer.

2. Download `yappa.jar` from the
   [latest GitHub release](https://github.com/minrui13/ip/releases/latest).

3. Place `yappa.jar` in an empty folder where you want to run Yappa.

4. Open a terminal in that folder and run:

   ```console
   java -jar yappa.jar
   ```
5. Yappa's GUI should appear. Type commands into the input box and press
Enter or the Send button to execute them.

6. Try some commands:

```
todo read chapter 5
deadline submit assignment /by 20/09/2026 2359
list
help
```

## Features
**Notes about command formats**
* Words in UPPER_CASE represent values that you need to provide.
* Task numbers correspond to the numbers shown by the list command.
* Task numbers must be positive integers starting from 1.
* Dates and times use the dd/MM/yyyy HHmm format and a 24-hour clock.
* Leading and trailing whitespace is ignored.
* Consecutive whitespace is treated as a single space.
* Commands that do not accept parameters will reject additional parameters.

For example:

```
deadline submit assignment /by 20/09/2026 2359
```

uses:

* `submit assignment` as the task description.
* `20/09/2026 2359` as the deadline.
